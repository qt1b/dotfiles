# what is this ?
a personal repo for config files and some scripts

## how to install
first, you MUST have nix installed on your system.

then, you can conveniently execute `install.sh` to have some of the config installed

## hyprland
most of the hyprland stuff is based on [hyprland-Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/), with lots of stuff removed to have a simpler config and use less battery

## zsh
i have not included zsh configs, but the theme I use is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for its ease of use and configurability

## install script
I plan on doing an install script, but the installation should be pretty straightforward in any case
